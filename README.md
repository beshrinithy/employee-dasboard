## About the Project

The Employee Dashboard aims to streamline the process of managing employee information. It allows HR managers or administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records efficiently. This project uses mock data to simulate employee information, making it suitable for demonstration and testing purposes.

- **View Employees:** Display a list of employees with their basic details.
- **Search Employees:** Search for employees by their ID.
- **View Details:** Click on an employee card to view detailed information.
- **Edit Employee Information:** Edit employee information (for display purposes only).
- **Delete Employees:** Delete individual employees or multiple selected employees.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure usability across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router:** For handling navigation within the single-page application.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS):** Used for styling components and ensuring responsiveness.
- **Mock Data:** Simulated employee data stored locally to mimic real-world scenarios.
